## Thirty Failed Attempts and a Cupboard Full of Honey

I've always been a big fan of honey. Ever since I was a kid, I thought honeycomb and all the different flavours of honey were something truly magical. Fast forward nearly 30 years, and it's now getting me in trouble.

I have a six-month-old son with chronic reflux, a sleepless wife who's at her wit's end, and I'm on my 30th attempt at growing a business through offshoring. It's 10 PM, I'm staring at a screen, scrolling through endless freelancer profiles, while my wife is behind me trying to run a house and being confronted by a truly ridiculous amount of honey in our cupboards.

She's yelling at me about the honey collection. I'm about to close the computer in defeat. Then something makes me click on tab seven – it was my lucky number. I look at the very top of that page, and there's a candidate with the highly unusual name of Honey.

I am definitely somebody who is not afraid to act upon signals and serendipity. Feeling as if I've just been given a clear indicator that this might be the one, I opened the profile and proceeded to reach out. Sometimes something incredibly simple like that can see you meeting somebody across the world and starting a new chapter together.

## Being Regional Matters

Years later, I've come to understand the heart of our success. We're regional people at our core, and we naturally connect with others who share that background.

While we've built wonderful relationships with clients from major cities, there's often a common thread—they've either grown up regionally before moving to the city, or they're simply cut from a different cloth than the typical corporate environment.

## The Power of Serendipity in Business

That moment of clicking on tab seven changed everything. What started as a defeated search through freelancer profiles turned into finding our first successful long-term partnership. Honey became not just an employee, but a cornerstone of our growing Philippines operations.

The lesson here isn't about superstition or lucky numbers—it's about remaining open to unexpected opportunities and being willing to act on them when they present themselves.

## Building Something Lasting

That serendipitous moment led to what we have today: a thriving outsourcing business with deep roots in the Philippines, built on genuine relationships rather than just cost savings.

Sometimes the best business decisions come from the most unexpected places. In my case, it came from a cupboard full of honey and the willingness to follow an unusual sign.
