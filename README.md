Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text

â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Bars.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Button.astro
        â””â”€â”€ CallToAction.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Footer.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Header.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Hero.astro
        â””â”€â”€ MarddownPost.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Reviews.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Service.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Tools.astro
        â””â”€â”€ Work.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
        â””â”€â”€ posts/
        â””â”€â”€ blog.astro
        â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ styles/
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
